The Animal Watch app allows children to easily find animals, in different ways
and to then watch educational videos about that animal. Although it may seem like a simple
YouTube search app, it allows parents to feel comfortable with the educational nature
of the videos their children are watching, and gives a simple interface that young
children can easily navigate. It uses JQuery and the 
YouTube and Encylclopedia of Life APIs.
